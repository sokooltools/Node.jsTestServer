[ Package.json version numbers]

In the simplest terms, the tilde matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). 
~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.

in our "package.json" the line:
		"express": "~4.9.0",
indicates any version 4.9.x meaning "4.9.0", "4.9.1", etc.

The caret, on the other hand, is more relaxed. 
It will update you to the most recent major version (the first number). 
^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.
