				<a>Displaying the <q>System Settings</q> Page</a>
				<div class="t1">
					The following is an example page displayed in the web browser when the <i>System Settings</i> tab is clicked:
				</div>
				<img id='p1' alt="" src="images/systemsettings/img01.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					The Machine Name is by default initially set to: <b>"PAC"</b> prepended to the digits making up the <i>MAC Address</i> of
					the default adapter on the PAC.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Clicking the <q>Refresh</q> button</a>
				<div class="t1">
					You can click the <span class="sp1">Refresh</span> button at the bottom of the page at any time to retrieve the latest values
					from the device:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/systemsettings/img02.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					Note that this is the preferable method versus clicking the browser's own refresh button which always resets and retrieves
					all the tabs and corresponding values instead of just the <q>values</q> being retrieved for the <i>current</i> tab....
				</div>
				<div class="t2">
					Whenever you make changes to the page, the name of the "<i>Refresh</i>" button automatically changes to "<i>Reset</i>".
					Subsequently resetting or saving the contents of the page results in the name of the button reverting back to "<i>Refresh</i>"...
				</div>
				<div class="t2">
					Another note of interest is that the <q>Machine Date Time</q> is automatically updated every second as long as there are no pending changes to be saved
					and only while the page is 'active'. That is, if you click another tab in the browser window, or click off the browser window altogether, 
					the automatic update will stop until the 'System Settings' page is reactivated.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Changing the <q>Machine Name</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					To change the <b>Machine Name</b>, click anywhere on the corresponding field (which is shown as being empty in the following
					example):
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/systemsettings/img03.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					Machine Name is a required field and must be entered before the <span class="sp1">System Settings</span> can be saved.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Validating the <q>Machine Name</q> before Saving Pt. 1</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Notice that as you change the <span class="sp1">Machine Name</span> a bright red border appears around the field and a notification
					frame appears near the top of the page:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/systemsettings/img04.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					This nuance occurs whenever you make changes to the data on a page which is considered to be invalid.
				</div>
				<div class="t2">
					The Machine Name must be a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 15 characters in length and must end with either a character or
					a digit. Only the following combination of characters can be entered into this field:<br />
					[a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] [-] (<i>dash</i>).
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Validating the <q>Machine Name</q> before Saving Pt. 2</a>
				<div class="t1">
					The <span class="sp1">Machine Name</span> in this example, although meeting the minimum of 4 characters in length, ends
					with a '-' (<i>dash</i>):

					If you wish to abandon any changes you make to the System Settings and return to the previously saved state, you can click

					Note that once the <b>Refresh Interval</b> is saved and the page is refreshed, the value displayed may differ
					(i.e., a value equally represented by a simpler unit of time) from what you initially entered.
					For example: if you were to enter <b>300 minutes</b>; it would be subsequently displayed as <b>5 hours</b> once the page is refreshed.
					On the other hand, entering a value such as <b>301 minutes</b> would not be affected.
