				<div class="t1">
					Depending on your user level you may or may not have rights to modify the data on the various tab pages such as those shown
					on the <b>Network Settings</b> page:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/common/img01.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					The user in this example has just 'read-access' to most fields, i.e., the fields are shown 'grayed out' indicating they
					cannot be modified. Also the <b>Save</b> button cannot be clicked. However the <b>Refresh</b> button can still be clicked
					and the alternate <b>Network Interface Controller</b> can still be chosen from the drop down list.
					<br />
					Note that the other tab pages operate in a similar fashion...
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Changing a user's login <q>Password</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					Only an <i>Admin</i> user can change the login password for <i>any</i> given user at anytime. For all other users (ie.,
					users <i>other</i> than the <i>Admin</i> user), most all fields (except the two password fields) are disabled. However,
					no matter your userlevel, you always have the ability to change your <i>own</i> login password at anytime by performing
					the following five steps:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/common/img05.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					1) Click the <b>Security</b> tab if it is not already the current tab.<br />
					2) Click the row in the grid containing your own username if it is not currently selected. (Note that your own username
					is automatically pre-selected the first time the Security tab is activated).<br />
					3) Enter the new password into the <b>New Password</b> field.<br />
					4) Enter the same new password into the <b>Confirm Password</b> field.<br />
					5) Click the <b>Save</b> button.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Changing the <b>Language</b> used for display</a>
				<div class="t1">
					You can change the <b>Language</b> the currrent page and all subsequent pages of the <b>PAC Configuration Tool</b> are displayed
					in at any time, by simply selecting the new language from the <i>Language</i> drop down.<br />
					<br />
					The following example shows the Login page with the <i>Language</i> drop down expanded and the <i>French</i> language being
					selected:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/common/img02.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					There are numerous languages available for selection, some of which which may or may not be available on your particular
					PAC. Consult with your PAC Administrator if your language preference is not currently available.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Displaying pages in a different language</a>
				<div class="t1">
					As an example, the <i>Login</i> page shown here has its primary information displayed in <i>French</i>.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/common/img03.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					You can set the language back to <i>English</i> or to another language by selecting it from the drop down as shown in the
					previous example.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Logging out from the <b>PAC Configuration Tool</b></a>
				<div class="t1">
					Once you are logged into the PAC Configuration Tool, you can choose to <i>logout</i> at any time by simply clicking the
					<b>Logout</b> button located at the top right of the page.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/common/img04.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Note that you can simply close the <b>PAC Configuration Tool</b> web page in your browser, and you will be automatically logged out after
					a few minutes, but clicking the <b>Logout</b> button, guarantees the best and most reliable overall security.
