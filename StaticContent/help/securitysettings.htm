			<li class="li2"><a>Displaying the <q>Security Settings</q> Page</a>
				<div class="t1">
					The following is an example of the page displayed in the web browser when the <i>Security Settings</i> tab is clicked for
					the very first time:
				</div>
				<img id='p1' alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img02.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Initially there is only a single user named <b>"Admin"</b> which is automatically added to the PAC and the <b>"Admin"</b>
					user <i>requires no password</i> to be entered* in order to login.<br />
					<br />
					(* For obvious security reasons, the empty password might be one of the first items you may want to change).
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Changing a User's <q>Password</q> Pt. 1</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Make sure the 'Admin' is selected in the grid, then click anywhere on the <b>New Password</b> field.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img03.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Notice that the group of dots (normally used to obfuscate the password from view), disappears and you can begin to enter
					a new password.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Changing a User's <q>Password</q> Pt. 2</a>
				<div class="t1">
					After entering a password into the <b>New Password</b> field, click anywhere on the <b>Confirm Password</b> field.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img04.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					You can begin entering the value into the <b>Confirm Password</b> field.<br />
					The password entered into this field must exactly match the password entered previously into the <b>New Password</b> field.<br />
					If the two password fields do not match exactly, a red border is drawn around the field and a red information frame appears
					at the top of the page containing information related to this discrepancy. Once the two password fields match, the red border
					and red information frame disappear.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Saving User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Save</b> button to make changes to <b>Security Settings</b> permanent.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img05.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					A progress notification is temporarily displayed. This notification disappears once the save has completed.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Saving User requiring no password</a>
				<div class="t1">
					There may be instances where for simplicity sake, you want yourself or another user to <i>NOT</i> have to enter a password
					in order to login to the PAC, (although for obvious security reasons, this is not highly recommended)!
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img06.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Place a checkmark into the <b>No Password Required</b> checkbox by clicking on it.<br />
					Notice that the two password fields are cleared and become disabled when the <b>No Password Required</b> checkbox contains
					a checkmark.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Resetting Security Settings</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Reset</b> button to discard changes you made inadvertently to the <b>Security Settings</b> anytime prior to
					clicking the <b>Save</b> button.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img07.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					A progress notification is temporarily displayed until the reset has completed at which time the <b>Reset</b> button is
					replaced by a <b>Refresh</b> button.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Refreshing Security Settings</a>
				<div class="t1">
					You can click the <b>Refresh</b> button anytime you wish to <i>refresh</i> the contents of the <b>Security Settings</b> tab page.<br />
					Note that the <b>Refresh</b> button is automatically replaced by a <b>Reset</b> button once any change is made to the currently
					displayed data.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img08.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					A progress notification is temporarily displayed until the <i>refresh</i> has completed.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Updating other User properties</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Aside from a unique username and password, all users have several other associated properties such as <b>Date Created</b>
					and <b>Date Modified</b> which are automatically maintained by the system (i.e., they are always <i>read-only</i> and shown
					<i>disabled</i> for any user selected).<br />
					Two other properties of users: <b>User Level</b> and <b>Login Enabled</b> are always <i>read-only</i> and <i>disabled</i>
					whenever the <i>Admin</i> user is selected.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img09.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Note that there are other properties <b>IP Address</b> and <b>Last Accessed</b> associated with all users (shown as two
					additional columns in the grid).<br />
					Each time a user logs into the PAC, the ip address the user is logging in from is recorded as is the date and time the PAC
					was last accessed from that ip address.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Adding a New User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Add User</b> button in the middle of the page to begin adding a new user.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img10.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					The <b>Username</b> field gains the focus and you can immediately begin entering a new username and then the corresponding
					passwords.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Setting User Level</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>User Level</b> drop-down to display the various choices for user level.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img11.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					By default all new users are provided with the <b>Guest</b> access level. This is the minimum access level available.<br />
					Also by default, new users have the ability to login to the PAC (i.e., the <b>Login Enabled</b> checkbox contains a checkmark).<br />
					In this example we are providing the user '<i>John</i>' with '<i>Supervisor</i>' user level access and his ability to login
					has been enabled.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Saving a New User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Save</b> button to add the new user ('John') to the PAC.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img12.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Notice a new row corresponding to the new user 'John' is now displayed in the grid. John has not logged in yet so obviously
					there is no IP Address nor Last Accessed data recorded.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Saving another New User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Repeat the same steps as above, this time adding a new user named '<i>Mary</i>' having the '<i>Operator</i>' access level.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img13.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Click the <b>Save</b> button and notice the new user 'Mary' is now displayed in the grid.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Updating a User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click on another user in the grid. Notice the properties of that user are shown in the editable fields at the bottom of
					the tab page and the mode is automatically set to [Update User] by default.
					<br />
					(The available modes are [Add User], [Update User], and [Remove User]).
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img14.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					You can begin to update the properties of the currently selected user or select another user to view/or update by selecting
					him or her from the grid.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Removing a User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Once a user is selected in the grid, you can click the <b>Remove User</b> button located in the middle of the page to indicate
					the current user should be removed.
					<br />
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img15.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					<br />
					Note that clicking <b>Remove User</b> changes the current display to show all the user's data with a strikeout through it,
					but the user is not actually removed until you click the <b>Save</b> button.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Removing a User from view</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Save</b> button to remove the user from view.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img16.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					You can always cancel a remove prior to clicking the <b>Save</b> button, by simply selecting another user from the grid.<br />
					Note that the 'Admin' user can never be removed; i.e., when the 'Admin' user is selected, the <b>Remove User</b> button
					is disabled.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Re-adding a Removed User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					For all practical purposes, once created, users are actually <i>NOT</i> permanently removed from the PAC; i.e., removed
					users become merely <i>hidden</i> from view. This is because of the need for historical tracking purposes.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img17.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					You can re-add (i.e., bring back into view), a removed user at anytime by simply clicking the <b>Add User</b> button then
					typing in the username and clicking the <b>Save</b> button. The original properties and other information such as <b>IP Address</b>
					and <b>Last Accessed</b> date and time are restored.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Saving a Re-added User</a>
				<div class="t1">
					In this example, type 'John' (who was removed an earlier example), into the <b>Username</b> field. Also select 'Engineer'
					from the <b>User Level</b> drop-down, then click the <b>Save</b> button.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img18.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					John reappears with his <i>original</i> creation date, but a modification date consisting of the current date and time.
					He also now has his user level set to 'Engineer'...
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Clicking the <q>Collapse All</q> button</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Collapse All</b> button located in the middle of the page to collapse the grid view to show only user names.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img19.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Clicking the <q>Expand All</q> button</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the <b>Expand All</b> button located in the middle of the page to expand the grid view to show all user names and
					all rows of historical data related to each user.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img20.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Maintaining Multiple Users</a>
				<div class="t1">
					The following shows a typical view of the <b>Security Settings</b> tab after the PAC has been logged into multiple times
					by the 'Admin' user from a number of different IP Addresses.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img21.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					Note that whenever you click on any row corresponding to an individual user, all the related rows are automatically selected.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Sorting rows of the grid in ascending order</a>
				<div class="t1">
					You can click any of the column headers in the grid to sort all the rows of the grid based on that column.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img22.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					In the example above, the <b>Date Modified</b> column has been sorted in <b><i>ascending</i></b> order.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Sorting rows of the grid in descending order</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Click the same column header currently used to sort all the rows of the grid to reverse the sort, (i.e., change the sort
					order from <i>ascending</i> to <i>descending</i> or vice versa).
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img23.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					In the example above, the <b>Date Modified</b> column has been sorted in <b><i>descending</i></b> order.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Non-Admin login Pt. 1</a>
				<div class="t1">
					If you are a user that does not have 'Admin' user level, whenever the Security Settings tab is first displayed, you will
					see the username you logged in with pre-selected in the grid.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img24.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					All fields other than the two password fields are read-only. This is true for all users other than users having the 'Admin'
					user level.<br />
					You can however, click the <b>New Password</b> and <b>Confirm Password</b> fields and type in a new password for yourself.
					Click the <b>Save</b> button to make the password change permanent.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Non-Admin login Pt. 2</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Only a user having the 'Admin' user level can modify other users. The following example shows a typical Security Settings
					tab view when a non-Admin user has logged in.
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/securitysettings/img25.png"/>
				<div class="t2">
					The currently selected user is 'David', but the user currently logged in is 'Darren', thus no changes can be made.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2"><a>Opening the <q>Online Help</q></a>

				<div class="t1">
					Click on the [<span class="sp1">?</span>] button at the upper right corner of the page to display this online help at any
					time:
