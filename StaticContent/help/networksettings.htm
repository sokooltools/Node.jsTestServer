				<a>Initial <q>Network Settings</q> page displayed</a>
				<div class="t1">
					The following is an example of the page displayed in the web browser after logging in successfully to the PAC:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img01.png" />
				<div class="t2">
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Changing the current <q>Network Interface Controller</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					You can view and/or configure the alternate <span class="sp1">Network Interface Controller (NIC)</span>, at anytime by selecting
					it from the drop-down:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img02.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					You must <i>save</i> any changes you make to the currently selected <span class="sp1">NIC</span> prior to selecting another
					<span class="sp1">NIC</span> from the drop-down to prevent the current changes from being discarded. (Note that you will
					be provided a warning with the ability to save your changes should this situation be encountered.)
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Changing an <q>IP Address</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					To change the <span class="sp1">IP Address</span>, click inside any one of its corresponding fields (a.k.a. "octets").<br />
					In the example below, the fourth octet of the <i>ip address</i> is selected and the <span class="sp2">delete</span> key
					is subsequently pressed:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img03.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					Whenever a field contains invalid information the field itself is surrounded with a red border and a notification message
					instantly displayed inside a red frame at the top of the page as shown above. Once valid information is entered into the
					field, the notification dissappears.
					<br />
				</div>
				<div class="t2">
					Instead of clicking each field (octet) using the mouse, you can use the keyboard to navigate. For example, you can press
					the <span class="sp2">tab</span> key to move from one octet to the next or <span class="sp2">shift+tab</span> to move to
					the previous octet; press the <span class="sp2">left-arrow</span> or <span class="sp2">right-arrow</span> keys to move a
					single character left or right or press the <span class="sp2">Home</span> or <span class="sp2">End</span> keys to quickly
					move to the beginning or to the end of the entire ip address field. You can select then type over existing digits, or press
					the <span class="sp2">backspace</span> or the <span class="sp2">delete</span> key and then retype the appropriate digit(s).
					Note that each ip address control only allows numbers to be typed in via the keyboard (or pasted in using the <span class="sp2">
						Ctrl-V
					</span> shortcut). You can also type a one or two digit number followed by a period causing the cursor to automatically
					jump to the next octet in the sequence.
				</div>

			<li class="li2">
				<a>Saving a changed <q>IP Address</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					The following example illustrates a valid <span class="sp1">IP Address</span> being entered followed by the <span class="sp1">
						Save
					</span> button being clicked:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img04.png" />
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Progress notifier displayed while <q>Saving</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					After the <span class="sp1">Save</span> button is clicked, the page is locked and a progress notifier displayed while the
					changes are being saved to the NIC:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img05.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					The page is unlocked and the progress notifier disappears automatically once the save has completed.
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Reboot dialog displayed following <q>Save</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					After a <span class="sp1">Save</span> has completed, a confirmation dialog appears asking whether you want to reboot the PAC in order to
					<i>finalize</i> the changes made to the Network Settings:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img05b.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					As described in the confirmation dialog itself, it is highly recommended that the PAC be rebooted following a change to an <i>ip address</i>.
					This assures that all the sub-systems get initialized to use the most current system values (i.e., re-attached to an <i>ip address</i>
					which may have changed).<br /><br />
					Clicking the <q>Yes</q> button will display another progress notifier indicating the system is being rebooted as shown in the next step:
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Progress notifier displayed while <q>Rebooting</q></a>
				<div class="t1">
					While the <span class="sp1">reboot</span> is taking place, a progress notifier is displayed:
				</div>
				<img alt="" src="images/networksettings/img05c.png" />
				<div class="t2">
					A reboot can take a minute or more so please be patient.
					After the reboot has completed the browser will be automatically redirected back to the <b>Login</b> page.<br /><br />
					Click the <q>No</q> button to skip this step and reboot the PAC at your own discretion.<br /><br />
					If you do select <q>No</q>, there will be a long pause (similar to what is shown in the next step)
					while the changes to the NIC take affect and your browser is automatically reconnected to the PAC:
				</div>
			</li>
			<li class="li2">
				<a>Progress notifier displayed while <q>Reconnecting</q> Pt. 1</a>
				<div class="t1">
					Whenever you change the <i>ip address</i> of the <span class="sp1">NIC</span> being used to communicate with the web server,
					the web page you are using to access the server, must ultimately be reconnected to the new <i>ip address</i>:

				<div class="t2">
					If for some reason the page above continues to be displayed for more than 20-30 seconds it usually means the <i>ip address</i> change
					and <i>auto-reconnect</i> process has stalled. Try clicking the browser's own <span class="sp1">Refresh</span> button to
					have it manually reconnect to the web server using the new <i>ip address</i> *.<br /><br />
					* On occasion you may also need to manually enter the <b>new</b> <i>ip address</i> (and <i>port number</i>) into the browser's
					address bar before clicking the browser's <span class="sp1">Refresh</span> button.

				<div class="t2">

				</div>
				<div class="t2">
					Whenever you make changes to the page, the name of the "<i>Refresh</i>" button automatically changes to "<i>Reset</i>".

					<span class="sp1">NIC</span> is <i>not</i> the one being used by the Active Web Server to communicate with the client. This
					is because changing a network connection to <i>Dynamic</i> results in an unknown <i>arbitrary</i> ip address being assigned
